OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

*Title:* "Continuous Testing with Jenkins and Selenium"

Objectives:

1. Implement continuous testing for faster feedback.
2. Automate testing for reduced manual effort.
3. Improve test coverage and accuracy.
4. Enhance collaboration between Dev and QA teams.

Key Activities:

1. Requirements gathering and analysis.
2. Test automation framework design.
3. Selenium test script development.
4. Jenkins setup and configuration.
5. Integration with Git for version control.
6. Test environment setup.
7. Continuous testing pipeline creation.

Technologies Used:

1. Jenkins (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
2. Selenium WebDriver (Automation Tool)
3. Java (Programming Language)
4. TestNG (Testing Framework)
5. Maven (Build Tool)
6. Git (Version Control System)
7. Allure Report (Test Reporting)

How it Works:

1. Developers commit code changes to Git.
2. Jenkins detects changes and triggers automated testing.
3. Selenium tests execute on designated test environments.
4. Test results are reported using Allure Report.
5. Jenkins integrates with TestNG for test management.
6. Continuous testing pipeline ensures timely feedback.

Continuous Testing Pipeline:

1. Code Commit (Git)
2. Build (Maven)
3. Test (Selenium)
4. Report (Allure)
5. Deploy (Jenkins)

Results:

1. Reduced testing cycle time by 70%.
2. Increased test automation coverage by 90%.
3. Improved defect detection rate by 40%.
4. Enhanced collaboration between Dev and QA teams.
5. Faster time-to-market.

Benefits:

1. Faster feedback loop.
2. Reduced manual testing efforts.
3. Improved product quality.
4. Increased test reliability.
5. Better scalability.
